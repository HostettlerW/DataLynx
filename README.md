# DataLynx
Python library for storing, tagging, grouping, and searching of URLs.

This concept was originally taken from my SWAM project. A major flaw of SWAM was that all functions related to data management were deeply tied to Tkinter GUI elements. This made changing either the GUI or updating the database functions difficult. Also, even when compiling SWAM into a native executable, the application launches slower than I'd like. That's why I started from scratch for the most part, although the file format of databases *should* be compatible.
